# Module 2 Challenge - VBA of Wall Street
### Overview of the Project: ###


&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The purpose of this analysis was to gain a better understanding for the ability to write different modules for different types of analysis. I learned how to create modules that reflected:<br/>

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;- Formatting<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;- Time<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;- Cell color<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;- Looping<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;- Message Boxes<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;- Imput boxes<br/>

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;It was important for us to work through different kinds of data along the way as it prepared us to create different results based on the year we entered. It ended up reulting in the ablity to find out how well, or poor, stocks do against each other and also how to find quicker, more elegant, ways to create code.

### Results: ###

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I know it seemed like just a little bit of time, however if you are running a large amount of code, it might mean the difference between making your deadline or not. In our case, it wasn't very much time and computers can run at amazing speeds. You can see in a side by side of each of th years 2017 and 2018 that the time difference was very different and helps support my findings.

### Summary: ###
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; As humans, anything that we do whether we believe it or not, there is always an advantage and a disadvantage to what we do. In this case, adjusting code to ensure lightning quick results and therefor getting a fresher and more easier to understand code that is less complex is a great example of an advantage of why we would want to go back and change our code. A disadvantage to this, would be that you may not know exactly how long it could take you to finalize code refactoring. The company I work for is dialing in on how much time is spent on certain actions. Budgeting time and by budgeting time, we are budgeting money. As code can take longer priods of time to go through, refactoring code could take an unknown amount of time and a company might run out of money mid-project which would result in smelly code.

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; I found wokring within VBA quite challenging as I had to ensure my code was written just right for the program to run. For instance ensuring I was consistant through my code with my values, my i's and j's were properly used, and overal ensured that I had every bit of code written in just in the right spot. Even though there are multiple ways of writing code, refactoring VBA script was challenging. Similarly to the priviously stated, an advantage to refactoring VBA data would be that you would get your results very fast. Nearly instantanious. Introducing an imbeded loop within the initial loop we were able to ensure the expedited speed,
