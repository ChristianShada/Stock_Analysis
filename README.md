# Module 2 Challenge - VBA of Wall Street
### Overview of the Project: ###


&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The purpose of this analysis was to gain a better understanding for the ability to write different modules for different types of analysis. I learned how to create modules that reflected:<br/>

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;- Formatting<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;- Time<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;- Cell color<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;- Looping<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;- Message Boxes<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;- Imput boxes<br/>

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;It was important for us to work through different kinds of data along the way as it prepared us to create different results based on the year we entered. It ended up reulting in the ablity to find out how well, or poor, stocks do against each other and also how to find quicker, more elegant, ways to create code.

### Results: ###

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I know it seemed like just a little bit of time, however if you are running a large amount of code, it might mean the difference between making your deadline or not. In our case, it wasn't very much time and computers can run at amazing speeds. You can see in a side by side of each of th years 2017 and 2018 that the time difference was very different and helps support my findings.

### Summary: ###
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;After writing the code and learning about a faster way, I learned that one must strive to write code the most expedent way first, therefore not needing to go back to clean it up. Not that it was not elegant the first time around. But it is important to get it right the first time. Refactoring code, in general, creates opportunity for bugs to get into the code that need to be cleared up, time/money for the time spent on cleaning up your own code that could have beed done better the first time around, lastly (and there are many other arguments), you may be on a time crunch. If you are starting to clean up your code and you don't have the time, it is best spent writing code correctly the first time

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;While working through the code,  I found that I wanted to test as i went along. This, in turn, took a longer time in doing so. It was strange in that it took longer to get a faster result. But it was in the results that I found the opposite of this argument. The other side of things is that you would get results much faster and that the benefit would be that the time that was put in would result in quicker answers. In addition to some of the advantages of refactoring is that you would clean up what has been done and create a program that would be more sustainable and most likely easier to improve upon later. Contrariwise, the more you touch somnething the more the opportunity for bugs to get in, using up time/money to fix the bugs, that may not have been needed in the first place.
