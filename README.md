# Module 2 Challenge - VBA of Wall Street
### Overview of the Project: ###


&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The purpose of this analysis was to gain a better understanding for the ability to write different modules for different types of analysis. I learned how to create modules that reflected:<br/>

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;- Formatting<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;- Time<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;- Cell color<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;- Looping<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;- Message Boxes<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;- Imput boxes<br/>

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;It was important for us to work through different kinds of data along the way as it prepared us to create different results based on the year we entered. It ended up reulting in the ablity to find out how well, or poor, stocks do against each other and also how to find quicker, more elegant, ways to create code.

### Results: ###

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I know it seemed like just a little bit of time, however if you are running a large amount of code, it might mean the difference between making your deadline or not. In our case, it wasn't very much time and computers can run at amazing speeds. You can see in a side by side of each of th years 2017 and 2018 that the time difference was very different and helps support my findings.
